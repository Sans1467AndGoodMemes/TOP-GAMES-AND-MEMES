The games I will be talking about are 
<p> 1. Super Smash Bros Ultimate </p>
<p> 2. Super Mario Galaxy 1 And 2 </p>
<p> 3. Super Mario Odyssey </p>
<p> 4. Luigis Mansion 3 (Working Title) </p>
<p> 5. Sonic Mania </p>


<p> So you might already know the Smash Bros Ultimate is the most pre-downloaded Nintendo game </p>
<p> It is probally the best smash game someone could ask for it has a total of 74 characters and 5 dlc packs</p>
<p> Not to mention its story mode is a whole different beast with hours of fun and an amazing soundtrack </p>

<p> It also has a spirit mode that is linked to the adventure mode and it is like nothing we have seen before </p>
<p> not to mention that you can play online and play locally with 8 different people! </p>
<p> overall Super Smash Bros Ultimate really is ultimate and i recommend you buy it i give it a 10/10</p>
