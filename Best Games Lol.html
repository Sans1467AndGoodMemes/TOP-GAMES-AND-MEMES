<h1> SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE REVIEW BEFORE ITS OUT LOL </h1>
</head>
<p> So you might already know the Smash Bros Ultimate is the most pre-downloaded Nintendo game </p>
<p> It is probably the best smash game someone could ask for it has a total of 74 characters and 5 DLC packs</p>
<p> Not to mention its story mode is a whole different beast with hours of fun and an amazing soundtrack </p>

<p> It also has a spirit mode that is linked to the adventure mode and it is like nothing we have seen before </p>
<p> not to mention that you can play online and play locally with 8 different people! </p>
<p> overall Super Smash Bros Ultimate really is ultimate and i recommend you buy it I give it a 10/10</p>

<h1> SUPER MARIO GALAXY 1 AND 2 </h1>
</head>
<p> Super Mario Galaxy 1 was made in 2007 and Super Mario Galaxy 2 was made in 2010 </p>
<p> Galaxy 1 sold 12.78M copies as of 2018 and Galaxy 2 sold 6.36M as of April 2011 </p>
<p> The galaxy games are critically acclaimed as some of the best games of all time! </p>
<p> Overall the galaxy games are the best games I have ever played and I strongly recommend them </p>
<p> They just have some of the best power ups physics and they made great childhood memories for me </p>
<p> This is why so many people want Super Mario Galaxy 3 because too many it was their childhood </p>
<p> Don't even get me started on the soundtracks they are phenomenal and l will link some below </p>
<p> So I am going to give Galaxy 1 and 2 a big 10/10! </p>
