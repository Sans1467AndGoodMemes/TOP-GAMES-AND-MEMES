<p> Fortnite needs fixed in many ways because it is turning into Minecraft dungeons the most dreaded game... </p>
<p> Fortnite's gun roster is failing and needs to be adjusted to make everything even and fair to play </p>
<p> First they should remove the turret because it us useless, they should nerf the rpg a bit or something</p>
<p> Heavy Shotgun is in a good place tacs need to get nerfed to make there fire rate and the legendary and other variants of pump are fine </P>
<p> they should vault some rarity's of AR because there is too many AR'S at this point i suggest the one of the bursts or normal ar's </p>
<p> They should add back semi auto's because they are a really good gun and also add get rid of the thermal cause it doesn't work</p>
<p> On to the good things about the game, it has great story and good items such as the quad crasher and the shadow stones which are amazing </p>
<p> on more recent news the THANOS cube NUKED the entire island and we got saved by a beautiful BUTTERFLY ya yeet </p>
<p> Thats just the issues with the game right now but the good stuff outnumbers the bad things </p>
