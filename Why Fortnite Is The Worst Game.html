<p> Fortnite needs fixed in many ways because it is turning into Minecraft dungeons the most dreaded game... </p>
<p> Fortnite's gun roster is failing and needs to be adjusted to make everything even and fair to play </p>
<p> First they should have 4 snipers only, the green hunting rifle, blue semi auto, purple bolt and golden heavy sniper
<p> No guns need to be removed at this time but they should nerf the rpg and also get rid of balloons because they server no purpose </p>
<p> Heavy Shotgun is in a good place tacs need to get nerfed to make there fire rate less because tac vs pump tac always wins </P>
<p> they should vault some rarity's of AR because there is too many AR'S at this point considering the Heavy AR is coming </p>
<p> They should add back semi auto's because they are a really good gun and also add get rid of the scoped AR or thermal </p>
<p> On to the good things about the game, it has great story and good mechanics at the minute like redaployable gliders </p>
<p> Thats just the issues with the game right now but the good stuff outnumbers the bad things </p>
<p> on more recent news the THANOS cube NUKED the entire island and we got saved by a buetiful BUTTERFLY ya yeet </p>
